Emotion recognizing software that plays a song from spotify based on your emotion



Using Microsoft Azure Face API, ihu is able to read the emotions of the img url posted on the input box and render a spotify playlist corresponding to the song. 

1. Copy an image address from any website.
2. Paste image-url in the input box and hit enter.
3. Your image will display as well as a recommended playlist from spotify.

Disclaimer: This is just an example of the app so the spotify playlist will only appear if happiness, anger or sadness levels are above 0.5.
